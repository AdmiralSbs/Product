Instructions:

When opening the program, it will prompt you for a kitchen.  If there is none, then select "Create New Kitchen" and make a name.

Navigation is through the buttons, which bring you to the various pages: [unavailable ones are greyed out]
Add Person - Creates a person object
Add Ingredient - Creates an ingredient object, which by default is unavailable in the kitchen
Add Recipe - Create a recipe object, which requires at least one ingredient, one person, a category, and a time
Remove ___ - Removes the object from the system COMPLETELY
Update Ingredient - Change the unit (if there is one), count (if there is one), availability (if there is no unit), priority
Edit Recipe - Change the values (looks like Add Recipe)
View Kitchen - See all the ingredients based off the parameters of Priority and Availability
View Menu - Choose the people and times, and your browser will display a menu with all available recipes

Notes on Objects -
All names are final

For Mrs. Ladwig:
You only need to copy and paste the jar file to run the program.
